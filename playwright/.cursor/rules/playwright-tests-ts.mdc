# Playwright Test Rules

Apply these rules to TypeScript test files (`**/*spec.ts`) in the `playwright` folder.

## General Guidelines

- Follow the Playwright style guide
- Write tests that are independent, idempotent, and can run in parallel
- Use clear, descriptive and distinct test names and group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Use `test.step()` to break down complex tests into readable steps

## Selector Preferences (in order)

1. **Role-based selectors**: `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })`
2. **Text content**: `page.getByText('Welcome', { exact: true })`
3. **Test IDs**: `page.getByTestId('submit-button')` (only when necessary)
4. **CSS selectors**: `page.locator('.selector')` (avoid when possible)

## Assertions

- Use web-first assertions that auto-wait: `expect(element).toBeVisible()`
- Avoid manual waits or `isVisible()` checks that don't auto-retry
- Use `expect.poll()` for non-DOM assertions like API responses

## Code Structure

- Only create helpers/fixtures for truly generic, reusable functionality
- Avoid page objects - tests should read like articles
- Use test steps and white spaces for separation

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Manual `sleep()` or `wait()` statements
- Fragile XPath selectors
- Tests that depend on other test state
- Over-abstraction that hurts test readability
